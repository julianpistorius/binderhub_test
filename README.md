# BinderHub Deployment on Jetstream

I'm testing out a deployment of [BinderHub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on [XSEDE Jetstream](https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/application/help).

My goal is to have a functioning Hub that I can start Binder Jupyter Notebooks /w RStudio on from my Github Pages.

# Kubernetes

Binder requires [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) and has instructions on how to install.

# Helm

I'm having trouble installing Helm - something to do with the Jetstream VM's 8080 port.

# BinderHub


# JupyterHub



# RStudio

[Rocker](https://hub.docker.com/u/rocker/) hosts useful RStudio images which are ready to do ([spatial](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/geospatial/)) analyses.
